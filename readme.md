#MANUAL implementation of Machine Learning Concepts
In learning process, especially in programming and machine learning I find myself larning concepts better when I implement the concepts myself,
in machine learning we can directly use the ready functions in the libraries in tensorflow, pytorch or scikit to do supervised or unsuperevised, deep learning, etc.
However it is important to know the mathematics and theory behind the algorithms to be able to adapt to and develop critical thinking to counter different scenarios. That being the motivation
I implemented several key basic concepts:

  --Supervised learning (implemented on a manually collected dog and cat images to do binary classification)

    -- SVM (including hard and soft margin and kernel)
    
    -- KNN (weighted KNN based on distances between features)

  --Unsupervised learning

    -- Kmeans discrete clustering (implemented on randomly generated points in 2D)
    
    -- GMM stochastic clustering (implemented on randomly generated points in 2D)
    
    -- PCA (implemented on kaggle dataset: countries' statistics on several features indicating possibility of famine and the countries that need to be targeted first.)
    
    -- SVD (based on  PCA)

  --Deep learning

    --CNN (implemented on an image to witness the process)

      -- Convolution layer

      -- Pooling layer

      -- Activation layer

    --Fully connected network and layer : in process
